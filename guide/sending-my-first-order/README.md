# Sending my first order

This section explains how to send your first, very minimal order to Tradecloud using the API.

This section assumes that you have all the prerequisites set up, as explained on the [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) page.
As part of that, you should have made a decision between:

* [Delivery Schedules vs Single Deliveries](../api/delivery-schedule.md)
* [JSON vs XML](../api/json-vs-xml.md)

Based on these decisions, go to one of the following pages:

{% page-ref page="sending-my-first-order-delivery-schedule-json.md" %}

{% page-ref page="sending-my-first-order-delivery-schedule-xml.md" %}

{% page-ref page="sending-my-first-order-single-delivery-json.md" %}

{% page-ref page="sending-my-first-order-single-delivery-xml.md" %}
