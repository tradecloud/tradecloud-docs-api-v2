# 1. Getting an Integration Account

In order to get an Integration account and some test suppliers:

1. Send an email to [Tradecloud Support](../support.md) including:
   * 2 email addresses:
     * **An integration email address**: This should be a non-personal email address, of which the mailbox is accessible to the integrator.
     * **A buyer email address**: This can be a personal or non-personal email address, which will be used to log into the Web Portal.
   * Your company name
   * Company names of two suppliers you want to use for testing, including their supplier number in your ERP. We will initially add test accounts to these supplier companies, so your supplier will not be involved in testing the integration yet.
2. Once you have received an integration account, you can test its username and password against `https://api.tradecloud1.com/v2/authentication/login` (See [Swagger API Specs](https://swagger-ui.accp.tradecloud1.com/?url=https://api.accp.tradecloud1.com/v2/authentication/specs.yaml#/authentication/login))
