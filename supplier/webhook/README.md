* a supplier change proposal is approved by the buyer
* a supplier change proposal is rejected by the buyer

## Receive an order from Tradecloud <a id="receive-an-order-response-from-tradecloud"></a>

To receive an order you will need to use the [webhook connector](https://tradecloud.gitbook.io/connectors/webhook-connector). When an order response is new or has been changed at Tradecloud, we will trigger your webhook.

You can either choose to receive the order id and GET the order yourself or alternatively to receive the order event which contains the affected lines.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you **GET the order yourself** you will get **ALL** the order lines.

When you use **the order event** it will **ONLY** contain the lines **affected** by the order event.
{% endhint %}

In case of a **GET webhook**, using the **order id** you can fetch the actual order from Tradecloud:

{% hint style="info" %}
[GET webhook eindpoint OpenAPI specification](https://swagger-ui.accp.tradecloud1.com/?url=https://api.accp.tradecloud1.com/v2/order-webhook-client/specs.yaml#/order-webhook%20endpoints/webhookGet)  
[API v2 GET order OpenAPI specification](https://swagger-ui.accp.tradecloud1.com/?url=https://api.accp.tradecloud1.com/v2/order/specs.yaml#/order/getOrderByIdRoute)
{% endhint %}

In case of **POST** or **PUT** **webhook** you can use the **order event** inside the request JSON body:

{% hint style="info" %}
