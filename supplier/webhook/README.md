# Receive an order

Tradecloud will send a new purchase order to the supplier when the buyer issues a purchase order.   
Tradecloud will send an updated purchase order when the buyer reissues a purchase order,  a supplier change proposal is approved by the buyer or when a buyer reopen request is approved by the supplier.

## Receive an order from Tradecloud <a id="receive-an-order-response-from-tradecloud"></a>

To receive an order you will need to use the [webhook connector](https://tradecloud.gitbook.io/connectors/webhook-connector). When an order response is new or has been changed at Tradecloud, we will trigger your webhook.

You can either choose to receive the order id and GET the order yourself or alternatively to receive the order event which contains the affected lines.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you **GET the order yourself** you will get **ALL** the order lines.

When you use **the order event** it will **ONLY** contain the lines **affected** by the order event.
{% endhint %}

In case of a **GET webhook**, using the **order id** you can fetch the actual order from Tradecloud:

[API v2 GET order OpenAPI specification](https://swagger-ui.accp.tradecloud1.com/?url=https://api.accp.tradecloud1.com/v2/order/specs.yaml#/order/getOrderByIdRoute)
{% endhint %}

In case of **POST** or **PUT** **webhook** you can use the **order event** inside the request JSON body:

{% endhint %}
