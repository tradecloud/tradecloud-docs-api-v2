description: How to announce a line has no goods delivery expected
---

# No delivery expected

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is planned
{% endhint %}

When a line has no goods to be delivered, for example a service, fee or text line, the line can be marked by setting `indicators.noDeliveryExpected` and update the order:

{% page-ref page="../update.md" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Lines having the `noDeliveryExpected`  indicator set will never become`Overdue`
{% endhint %}
