  How to announce a line should always become a proposal when accepted by the
  supplier
---

# Propose when accepted

Use `Propose when accepted` when your order process requires the buyer to always approve every order line, even when the supplier accepts \(confirms with requested values\) the order line. Every `Accepted by supplier` line becomes a proposal with requested values.

You can set `Propose when accepted` by using the `/order` API resource, by setting the `indicators.proposeWhenAccepted` on line level.
