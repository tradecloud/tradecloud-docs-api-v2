## Directory Structure

Each customer has a dedicated folder structure for organized file management:

```shell
📁 /order                    # Incoming orders
📁 /order_change             # Order modifications  
📁 /order_response           # Order confirmations
📁 /despatch_advice          # Shipment notifications
📁 /receipt_advice           # Goods receipt confirmations
📁 /archive/
  ├── order/                 # Processed order files
  ├── order_change/          # Processed order changes
  ├── order_response/        # Processed responses
  ├── despatch_advice/       # Processed shipments
  └── receipt_advice/        # Processed receipts
```

## Integration Workflows

### Uploading Files to Tradecloud

#### Customer → Tradecloud data flow

1. **Export** - Generate file from your ERP system
2. **Upload** - Transfer file to appropriate folder via SFTP
3. **Process** - Tradecloud automatically detects and imports the file
4. **Archive** - Successfully processed files are moved to archive

{% hint style="warning" %}
**File Permissions**: Use `0664` permissions when uploading files. This is required per the [SFTP specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-13#section-7.6) and ensures proper file processing.
{% endhint %}

### Downloading Files from Tradecloud

#### Tradecloud → Customer data flow

1. **Generate** - Tradecloud creates file based on business events
2. **Upload** - File is placed in your designated folder
3. **Download** - Your system retrieves the file via SFTP polling
4. **Process** - Import file into your ERP system
5. **Archive** - Move processed files to archive folder

## Best Practices

- **Polling Frequency**: Check for new files every 5-15 minutes
- **File Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for easier processing
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for failed transfers
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for processing failures or connection issues
- **Cleanup**: Regularly archive or remove old files to maintain performance
