# Connectors

Tradecloud provides several connector types that complement the standard API integration, offering alternative methods for data exchange and authentication to meet diverse integration requirements.

## Overview

These connectors are **additions to the API connector**, providing specialized integration patterns:

- **Real-time push messaging** through webhook connectors
- **File-based integration** through FTP connectors  
- **Single Sign-On authentication** through Azure Active Directory

The webhook connectors work **in conjunction with the API** to push messages to customers when orders, shipments, or documents are created or updated, eliminating the need for continuous polling.

## Connector Types

- Support for both JSON and XML formats
- Filtered event delivery based on your requirements
- Works alongside API calls for complete integration

**Best for:** High-volume, real-time integrations with existing web infrastructure.
