# Polling pattern implementation guide

The polling API offers an alternative to the webhook API for retrieving order or shipment updates. Both approaches have different advantages and considerations:

{% page-ref page="../webhook-vs-polling.md" %}

## Overview

The polling pattern consists of three essential steps:

1. **Fetch** - Retrieve orders or shipments changed since the last poll.
2. **Process** - Handle the retrieved new or updated data.
3. **Persist** - Store the latest timestamp for the next polling cycle.

## Implementation steps

### Step 1: Fetch updated data periodically

Set up a scheduled process to fetch all orders or shipments that have been created or changed since your last poll.

#### Polling best practices

- Use a consistent polling interval (typically 5 minutes)
- Include the `lastUpdatedAt` timestamp from previous poll response as the `lastUpdatedAfter` filter.
  - **Do not use the system clock time** for `lastUpdatedAfter` â€“ clock skew or availability issues can cause you to miss updates.
- Set `limit=100` (the maximum allowed value) to control response size.
- Handle pagination when needed:
  - If response contains `total` > 100, not all updates were returned.
  - Either decrease the polling period (recommended) or use the `offset` parameter for paging.

#### Available endpoints

| Data Type                  | Endpoint                                                                                                                                                                            | Use Case                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Orders (delivery schedule) | [Poll orders](https://swagger-ui.accp.tradecloud1.com/?url=https://api.accp.tradecloud1.com/v2/order-search/specs.yaml#/order-search/pollOrdersRoute)                               | For orders using delivery schedule feature |
| Orders (single delivery)   | [Poll single delivery orders](https://swagger-ui.accp.tradecloud1.com/?url=https://api.accp.tradecloud1.com/v2/order-search/specs.yaml#/order-search/pollOrdersSingleDeliveryRoute) | For orders using single delivery per line  |
| Shipments                  | [Poll shipments](https://swagger-ui.accp.tradecloud1.com/?url=https://api.accp.tradecloud1.com/v2/shipment/specs.yaml#/shipment/pollShipmentsRoute)                                 | For shipment updates                       |

#### Example request

```http
GET /v2/order-search/poll

{
  "filters": {
    "lastUpdatedAfter": "2025-04-23T10:01:53.812Z"
  },
  "limit": 100
}
```

#### Buyer: filter on Confirmed orders

Optionally, the buyer can filter on Confirmed orders and ignore orders with other statuses.

```http
GET /v2/order-search/poll

{
  "filters": {
    "status": {
      "processStatus": ["Confirmed"]
    },
    "lastUpdatedAfter": "2025-04-23T10:01:53.812Z"
  },
  "limit": 100
}
```

- The buyer receives an order only when **all lines are confirmed** at order level.  
- Individual order lines can still contain different process or logistics statuses (for example, *Cancelled* or *Delivered*). Use the line-level status fields to filter these lines as required.

#### Suppliers: filter on Issued orders

Optionally, the supplier can filter on Issued orders and ignore orders with other statuses.

```http
GET /v2/order-search/poll

{
  "filters": {
    "status": {
      "processStatus": ["Issued"]
    },
    "lastUpdatedAfter": "2025-04-23T10:01:53.812Z"
  },
  "limit": 100
}
```

- The supplier may still receive **Issued orders that have been updated** by the buyer.
- If you are a supplier, check if the purchase order already exists in your ERP system and either ignore the update or update the existing order.

### Step 2: Process retrieved data

Implement logic to handle the fetched new or updated orders or shipments.

#### Example response

```http
{
  "data": [
    {
      "supplierAccountNumber": "SUPPLIER12345",
      "purchaseOrderNumber": "PO123456789",
      "lines": [
        {
          "deliverySchedule" ...
          "prices" ...
          "status": {
            "processStatus": "Issued",
            "logisticsStatus": "Open"
          },
          "lastUpdatedAt": "2025-04-23T10:01:53.812Z"
        }
      ],
      "status": {
        "processStatus": "Issued",
        "logisticsStatus": "Open"
      },
      "lastUpdatedAt": "2025-04-23T10:01:53.812Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 10,
  "lastUpdatedAt": "2025-04-23T10:01:53.812Z"
}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your poll results may include outdated data in case of an echo from a recent request. See [Polling Echo Handling](echo.md) for managing outdated data.
{% endhint %}

#### Order processing tips

When working with order endpoints:

- The supplier must check whether the purchase order already exists in their ERP system and either ignore the update or update the existing order.
- Use `data.lines.lastUpdatedAt` to identify which specific lines have changed since the `lastUpdatedAfter` time you provided.
- Filter by order- and line-level status using `data.status` and `data.lines.status` fields:
  - `processStatus`
  - `inProgressStatus`
  - `logisticsStatus`
  - `deliveryLineStatus`

#### Shipment processing tips

When working with the shipment endpoint:

- Use `data.lines.meta.lastUpdatedAt` to identify changed shipment lines since the `lastUpdatedAfter` time you provided.
- Filter by `data.status` to focus on relevant shipment statuses

### Step 3: Persist the timestamp

Store the `lastUpdatedAt` value to use as `lastUpdatedAfter` in subsequent requests.

When the poll response is empty, keep using the same timestamp until you get results.

#### Implementation tips

- The timestamp has format `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.SSSZ` (ISO 8601). Persist the full timestamp, including the  `Z` timezone indicator, and send it back with the next polling request.
- Persist **the complete timestamp string** to prevent timezone conversion issues.
- Store it in **durable storage** (database or file system).
- Your storage solution **must survive application restarts or crashes**.
- If the response contains no data, reuse the current `lastUpdatedAfter` value.
- For first-time polling, use a well-chosen historical date to retrieve or skip existing orders.
