## JSON Web Tokens

## OpenAPI

The [OpenAPI Version 2.0 Specification (OAS 2.0)](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) creates a RESTful interface for easily developing and consuming an API by effectively mapping all the resources and operations associated with it.

## REST

[Representational state transfer (REST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer
) is not a standard but a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. The API additionally uses a command and query style.

## UTF-8

ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8

Published as [RFC 9259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-8.1)
