# Supplier Order Process

## Order Process Steps

### 1. Receive Purchase Orders

As a supplier, you can [receive purchase orders](receive/) from your buyers.

You can also:

- [Download documents](receive/download-document.md) attached to orders

### 2. Respond to Orders

After receiving an order, you should [send an order response](send-order-response/) to the buyer.

You can:

- Accept or reject the order (in whole or by line)
- Propose changes to delivery dates, quantities, or prices
- [Attach documents](send-order-response/attach-document.md) to your responses

### 3. Reopen Orders

If needed, you can [reopen an order](reopen.md) to restart the order process after it has been completed.
